# Wheather App

[Visit the app ðŸ‘€ ](https://bazarchic.vercel.app/) 

### Overview: 

Welcome to the City Weather App, a project where you can check the current weather and the forecast for the upcoming days of your favorite city. What sets this app apart is its dynamic background feature, automatically adjusting between light and dark colors based on the searched city's current time.

This project represents a reiteration of a concept I initially implemented a year ago using Vanilla JavaScript. In this version, I've chosen to leverage the power of Next.js and React Query to enhance the application's architecture and streamline data fetching from two different APIs. Through this projet, I also used Styled components.


### API
[Opencagedata](https://opencagedata.com/) | [Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/)

### Deployment

The application is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), providing a live preview of the landing page.

### Framworks or libraries Used

- Nextjs
- React Query
- Styled components
- Typescript

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies 
3. Execute `npm run dev` to run the projet. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### Acknowledgements

This project is a result of experimentation and practice in web development. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback.
